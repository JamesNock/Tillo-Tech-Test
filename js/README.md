# Tillo Technical Test

## Front-end Engineer - JavaScript/Vue.js

**PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT FULLY**

The aim of these tasks is to test your approach to solving the problems.

This project contains a simple web app made with Vue.js which displays a table of orders and information about the purchaser etc.

In its current state it is not working correctly and it is your job to fix the issues where you can.

## Your Task

Use a combination of the browser console and the automated tests supplied to figure out how to fix the issues in the app.

Edit the code in [`/src`](./src) to solve the problems in [ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md).

In [SOLUTIONS.md](./SOLUTIONS.md), explain in plain English and in simple terms, what the problem was and how you solved it.

Run the automated tests to confirm you have solved the problems.

**Try to get as many of the tests (`npm run test`) passing as you can!**

## When you are done

1. Delete the node_modules folder from the project
2. Zip up the project
3. Send us the zip file containing the project

## Tips

- Don't worry if you're not too familar with Vue.js, most of the issues do not rely on knowlege of the framework to solve.
- If you want to see the state of the data inside the application, install the Vue Dev Tools on your browser: https://devtools.vuejs.org/
- Some issues may be harder than others to fix, so if you get stuck, move on.

## Rules

1. Don't edit **any** files in the [`tests`](./tests) folder unless instructed to!
2. Don't spend more than an hour and a half on the technical test — if you can't fix all of the issues, don't worry about it.

## Project setup

You will need NodeJS and NPM installed to be able to run this project. Both can be installed via the links on this page: https://nodejs.org/en/ (NPM is included with the NodeJS instalation). **This test is compatible with the latest LTS version of NodeJS**

First, install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

after installing, npm may warn about vulnerabilities. It's safe to ingore this warning in the case of this technical test.

Then run the dev server:

```
npm run serve
```

You can run the automated tests with this command:

```
npm run test
```

The automated tests can be run in 'watch mode' with:

```
npm run test:watch
```

The app has been tested in Google Chrome and Firefox — please use one of these browsers.
